# Twitter to Video

### Introduction
In this project, we will be creating a multi-threaded application that picks the top 20 tweets from a Twitter handle and makes a 30 sec video out of it.
Every three seconds, the top tweet will be shown along with their profile picture and username.

### How to Run?
This application requires primarily Tweepy, Python 3, and other packages specified in the requirements.txt file.

Please make sure all APIs have been installed before running the program. To run the program, run python main.py. 
Twitter keys must be in the root program directory named keys. The following is the format needed.

```python
[auth]
consumer_key = ****
consumer_secret = ****
access_token = ****
access_secret = ****
```
