# Twitter to Video

### Introduction
In this project, we will be creating a multi-threaded application that picks the top 20 tweets from a Twitter handle and makes a 60 sec video out of it.
Every 3 seconds, the top tweet will be shown along with their profile picture and username. Currently, the application is a single
process running with 4 threads. The output format is a 1024x768 resolution mp4 file running at 25 frames per second. Each of the 4
threads is responsible for image processing, specifically creating the backgroud, drawing the username, user picture and writing the
tweet for all twenty images.

### Computer Evaluation

In my current computer configuration, I have a 6-core processor with 12 threads and a maximum clock rate of 4.1 Ghz. As a result of this, I am really unable to see any bottlenecks when running code conversion tests which were the following:

```python
ffmpeg.exe -i test.mp4 -c:a copy -c:v copy -r 30 -s hd720 -b:v 2M output.mp4
```

```python
ffmpeg.exe -i test.mp4 -c:a copy -c:v copy -r 30 -s hd480 -b:v 1M output.mp4
```

Each of the commands on a 3 minute test video finished in < 1 seconds. Because of this, we will be running the program with 4 threads which is overkill.

### How to Run?
This application requires primarily Tweepy, Python 3, and other packages specified in the requirements.txt file.

Please make sure all APIs have been installed before running the program. To run the program, run python main.py. 
Twitter keys must be in the root program directory named keys. The following is the format needed.

```python
[auth]
consumer_key = ****
consumer_secret = ****
access_token = ****
access_secret = ****
```

The following screenshots is the cli program in action and working:

### Results
The bottleneck for the program is actually the image processing side. While the entire process finishes in approximately 3 secs, 4 threads really pushes the cpu and since it is a very powerful laptop CPU, results are available right away. The following snippet is a picture of the CPU usage when grabbing tweets with the Twitter API, image processig forming the final images for FFMPEG, and running FFMPEG. The program itself is using the 4 threads to process image requests from a Queue and the FFMPEG API is multithreaded from the operating system/HW.

The application will alert the user when the video has been done processing specifying which video has completed. The user has the ability to schedule multiple Twitter videos which is still being processed by the 4 threads. However, subsequent FFMPEG calls are new processes. The next steps for this project is to have a web interface of some sort can be utilized for a much better user experience. There are also some corner cases that may need to be taken care of. However, as of currently, there are no inputs that could crash the application.
